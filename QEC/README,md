# Quantum Error Correction

## Overview  
Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential to protect fragile quantum information from noise and decoherence, enabling reliable quantum computation.

This project explores foundational quantum error correction codes and their implementation using Qiskit simulations.

## What is Quantum Error Correction?  
Unlike classical bits, qubits are vulnerable to errors due to interactions with their environment (decoherence) and imperfect gate operations. Measuring qubits directly collapses their state, so QEC codes cleverly encode a logical qubit across multiple physical qubits to detect and correct errors without destroying quantum information.

## Codes Covered  
- **Bit-Flip Code:** Protects against bit-flip errors by encoding one qubit into three.  
- **Phase-Flip Code:** Corrects phase-flip errors.  
- **Shor Code (Intro):** Combines bit-flip and phase-flip codes for more robust correction.

## How to Run  
1. Install Qiskit if you havenâ€™t already:  
      ```bash
pip install qiskit
