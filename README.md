# Quantum-Computing-Research

This repository contains my personal projects and experiments in quantum computing and quantum cryptography.  
It covers foundational algorithms, quantum key distribution, post-quantum cryptography, and error correction.

## Projects

- [BB84 Protocol](./BB84-Protocol): Quantum key distribution protocol simulation using Qiskit.  
- [Shor's Algorithm](./Shors-Algorithm): Factoring integers with quantum algorithms.  
- [Grover's Search](./Grovers-Search): Quantum search algorithm and cryptographic implications.  
- [Post-Quantum Cryptography](./Post-Quantum-Crypto): Implementation of lattice-based and code-based crypto schemes.  
- [Error Correction](./Error-Correction): Exploring quantum noise and simple error-correcting codes.

## Goals

- Deepen understanding of quantum algorithms and their cryptographic impact.  
- Develop practical quantum programming skills with Qiskit.  
- Contribute to open source and engage with the quantum community.
