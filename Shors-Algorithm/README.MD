# Shor's Algorithm for Integer Factorization

## Overview  
This project demonstrates Shor's quantum algorithm to factor integers efficiently, showcasing the potential impact of quantum computing on classical cryptography.

## Features  
- Implementation of Shor's algorithm using Qiskit  
- Factoring small composite integers (e.g., 15, 21)  
- Explanation of quantum phase estimation and modular exponentiation  
- Discussion on limitations with current quantum hardware

## Requirements  
- Python 3.7+  
- Qiskit library (`pip install qiskit`)

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repo and navigate to this folder.  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install qiskit`  
3. Run the script: `python shors_algorithm.py`  
4. Review the output for factored integers and circuit details.

## Background  
Shor's algorithm provides an exponential speedup over classical factoring algorithms, threatening RSA and related cryptographic schemes.
